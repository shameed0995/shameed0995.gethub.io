<p align="justify"style="font-size:160%;">C is a general-purpose programming language which features
 economy of expression, modern control flow and
 data structures, and a rich set of operators.C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized
 to any particular area of application.But its absence of restrictions and its generality make 
 it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.
 The history of C programming language is quite interesting. C was originally designed for and implemented 
 on the UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-ll, by Dennis Ritchie.
 C is the result of a development process that started with an older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by 
 Martin Richards, and it influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. 
 B led to the development of C in the 1970s.
